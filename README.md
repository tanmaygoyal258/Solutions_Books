# Solutions_Books

In this repository, I will upload the PDFs and LaTeX source files which contain the solutions to (most) exercises of books I am currently in the middle of reading and understanding. This allows me to verbalize my thoughts for the solutions better and will also help others, since solution manuals may or may not be available on the internet, and even if they are, they are usually less verbose. Please feel free to contact me if you find any errors in the solutions.
