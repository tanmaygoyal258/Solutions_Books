# Solutions_Books

This repository contains solutions to (most) exercises of books that I am currently reading and understanding. This will help me verabloze my thoughts for the solution better. I also hope this will help others, since solution manuals may or may not be available on the internet, and sometimes, these manuals, even if available, are not verbose enough for understanding. Hopefully, my solutions would be verbose enough to be easily understandable. Please feel free to contact me if you come across an error of any kind.
