# Solutions_Books

This repository contains solutions to (most) exercises of books that I am currently reading and understanding. This will help me verbalize my thoughts for the solutions better. I also hope this will help others, since solution manuals may or may not be available on the internet, and sometimes, these manuals, even if available, are not verbose enough for understanding. Hopefully, my solutions would be easily understandable. Please feel free to contact me if you come across an error of any kind.
