\subsection{Finite Dimensional Normed Spaces}

\begin{question}
    Give examples of subspaces of $\ell^\infty$ and $\ell^2$ which are not closed.
    \label{section2.4}
\end{question}
\begin{proof}
    Consider the subspaces with finitely many non-zero terms. For example, take the sequence 
    \[x_n = \left(1 , \frac{1}{2} , \frac{1}{3} , \ldots \frac{1}{n} , 0 , \ldots  \right)\]
    Then, this sequence belongs to both $\ell^2$ and $\ell^ \infty$ spaces, however, the limit, does not have finitely many non-zero terms, and hence, does not belong to the subspaces. Thus, the subspaces are not closed.
\end{proof}
